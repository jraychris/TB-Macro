# TB-Macro
A simple article formatting macro for MS word

This project was written as a labor-saving device. It's designed to take articles written by online content services and format them in a uniform manner. It includes functions that identify sub-headers, remove excess linebreaks and spaces, correct capitalization, remove hyperlinks, and highlight paragraphs that are too long.

The code also includes a separate function that checks the length of paragraphs and sentences every 3 seconds. Paragraphs above 6 lines are highlihgted in red and sentences longer than 20 words are highlighted in green. This function has a 'start' macro and a 'stop' macro.
